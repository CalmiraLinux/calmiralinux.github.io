    <p>After a rather long lull, I continue to work on the dpkg package manager. Let me remind you of his story: after the release of Calmira 2021.1 GNU/Linux, he began developing the package manager pkg-utils. Subsequently, it was transformed into a simpler and more reliable cpkg. It was written in Shell and provided functions for installing, deleting, and viewing package information. But he did not enter into Calmira LX4 1.0 GNU/Linux, and later it was announced that the development of this PM was discontinued.</p>

    <p>After some thought, I decided to continue its development. The new version (2.0) will be rewritten in Python. Work with the database will be added, as well as many other changes. The release is scheduled for the end of 2022.</p>

    <p>After assembling the next (No. 2) build of the system, some problems were identified during system boot - on some configurations, the system could not boot correctly, or did not boot at all. This problem was manifested on the 5.15.5 kernel, there was no such problem on the previous version 5.1. In test builds, a *temporary* rollback to 5.1 was made.</p>
