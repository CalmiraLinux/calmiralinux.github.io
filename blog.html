    <p>After assembling the next (No. 2) build of the system, some problems were identified during system boot - on some configurations, the system could not boot correctly, or did not boot at all. This problem was manifested on the 5.15.5 kernel, there was no such problem on the previous version 5.1. In test builds, a *temporary* rollback to 5.1 was made.</p>
